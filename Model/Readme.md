# Modelling

This mathematica code illustrates the results of the model, with some characteristic parameters already chosen to plot the results. It is possible to change them (or play with the manipulate plots) to see the changes in the results. Plots are generated inside the notebook, which should be run cell by cell in order. Functions and parameters are commented and defined before the code cells, as well as explanations of what is done in each section. There are no special mathemtaica modules needed.
